This year started with my domain being taken over by a scam site because I was foolish enough to take down my old one, leave the DNS records pointing to GitHub, and then do nothing. Lesson learnt. Regardless of that little inconvenience, my plan is to record as much as possible to document progress over this year. Below, I have listed some of my aims and goals.

### Health and Fitness
- Reduce weight to below 90 kg.
- Climb at a V4 level.
- Run a 5k in under 25 minutes (current PB is 29:41).

### Work and Education
- Improve backend development skills.
- Complete three AWS certifications.
- Finish a game for a game jam.

These goals might change over the course of the year, but hopefully, I will be able to look back and see progress as I go.
