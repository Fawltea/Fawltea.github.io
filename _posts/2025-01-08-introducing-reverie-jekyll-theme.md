title: What 2025 Holds
categories: [Life, Goals]

This year started with this domain being hijacked and replaced by what I assume was a scam site. Despite that minor hiccup, I plan to use this blog as a way to keep track of my progress and hold myself accountable. To start, here’s a list of my goals for the year:

### Health and Fitness
- Drop weight below 90 kg.
- Climb at a V4 level.
- Run a 5k under 25 minutes (current PB is 29:41).

### Work and Education
- Improve backend development skills.
- Complete 3 AWS certifications.
- Finish a game for a game jam.

Who knows what 2025 holds, but whatever it does, I’ll keep a record of it here!
